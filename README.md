Dead simple project. I always used to get bored to death with these TODO's sample apps from your friendly neighborhood web framework but been having a blast so far doing the same on a system's programming language. Having to deal with all complexities and specificities of operating systems and file systems has been an enlightening journey so far.

My goal with this repository is to start a rosetta code style project of low-level CLI todo apps with novelty and up-and-coming programming languages. Just don't expect me to reimplement this on node or python but instead on nim or crystal.
